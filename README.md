## üìö About This Project

This project is a **proof-of-concept (PoC)** for educational and awareness purposes.

It demonstrates how the Windows API [`SetWindowDisplayAffinity`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowdisplayaffinity) can be used to hide a window from screen recording and screenshot tools.

## üîç tools

Inspired by tools like [InterviewCoder](https://www.interviewcoder.co/) ([see article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/09/google-ai-interview-coder-cheat.html)), this project shows how simple techniques can bypass screen sharing detection.

By applying `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE`, a window's content will be hidden from screen recorders and remote viewers ‚Äî meaning interviewers may not see what the user is actually doing.
