## 📚 About This Project

This project is a **proof-of-concept (PoC)** for educational and awareness purposes.

It demonstrates how the Windows API [`SetWindowDisplayAffinity`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowdisplayaffinity) can be used to hide a window from screen recording and screenshot tools.

##  tools

Inspired by tools like [InterviewCoder](https://www.interviewcoder.co/) ([see article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/09/google-ai-interview-coder-cheat.html)), this project shows how simple techniques can bypass screen sharing detection.

By applying `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE`, a window's content will be hidden from screen recorders and remote viewers — meaning interviewers may not see what the user is actually doing.

<h3 align="center">Anti-Screen detection PoC</h3>

<p align="center">
 By monitoring the currently focused window, I can detect if someone is interacting with applications that aren't visible through screen sharing. This helps identify when users switch hidden windows during a session
